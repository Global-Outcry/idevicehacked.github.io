          <h1>How did it start?</h1>
          <p>It all started because of Junesiphone mainly. He was a big inspiration to me. His most amazing tweaks to me were LockPlusPro and FrontPage, these both really opened my eyes to what amazing things I can do with a Jailbreak. Once I saw the capability
            of jailbreaking it really got me back into coding. But before I started coding tweaks I started with first with widgets on Anemone. Boots and Evelyn were both big inspirations when I am designing my widgets. So basically my repo has started
            with inspiration from others and see what amazing capabilities can come from jailbreaking. Also just wanting to improve on what Apple have had implemented into their devices.</p>

          <h1>Why I code.</h1>
          <p>Some questions that I get is why I code and sometimes I get asked how to start. The way I started coding was that I learned the basics of the language which I wanted to do and then I just went from there by teaching myself by just seeing what
            works and lots of googling. Now to start coding it is pretty easy all you need to do is first start by downloading a good text editor like sublime or if you want a WYSIWYG then use DreamWeaver. DreamWeaver has a live coding view so you can
            code then look up and see what you are making. The next step would be finding good tutorials online which have all the basics. Next just start coding and then you will easily see what does what. </p>

        <div class="col four left">
          <h1>My hobbies?</h1>
          <p>I have some pretty basic hobbies. One thing that I enjoy the most is coding. Coding has made a big impact on my life and will have probably have changed my life forever. The reason I enjoy coding so much is that I love computers and just making
            things. Another hobby of mine is working on my 2010 V6 Mustang. (I've heard the memes you aren't funny) I enjoy cars as a whole, and they are just amazing in my opinion. The reason I enjoy working on my car is that it's my first car I got
            and I just enjoy making things better. To me, the Mustangs are nice reliables cars but the reason I like to work on it is that they aren't the fastest car in the world so I like to improve its performance.</p>

        <div class="col four left">
          <h1>Stress get aways.</h1>
          <p>Generally, there are lots of things I like to do and see. I've always enjoyed going out for a drive and with no music or no destination. In my opinion, Saturday drives are one of the best things to do, they are really calming too when I've had
            a stressful week. Although sometimes if it's rainy or if I'm just lazy one day I like to just get on my laptop and code whatever; it's like a small escape where I can control everything and get things from nothing to something. Whenever you
            get to code something from nothing to something it's really satisfying, but the best thing to do when coding has music. Most people have one type they enjoy but I base all my music on my mood which really helps me.</p>
